Lyrics
 
There ain’t no gold
In this river
That I’ve been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope
In these waters
But I can’t bring myself to swim 
When I am drowning 
In this silence baby let me in
 
Go easy on me baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to 
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain’t no room 
For things to change
When we are both so deeply 
Stuck in our ways
You can’t deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was
To put you both first
But now I give up 
 
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn’t even show

Lyrics
I ain’t got too much time to spare
But I’ll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I’m still spinning out of control from the fall 
Boy you give good love I won’t lie
It’s what keeps me coming back even though I’m terrified 
 
I know that it’s wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah

Oh my god I can’t believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of 
Jumping out of my life 
And into your arms
Maybe baby I’m just losing my mind
Cause this is trouble 
But it feels right teetering on the edge
Of heaven and hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight
